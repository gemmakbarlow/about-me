_"To be considered for a WWDC 2015 Scholarship, use your creativity and coding skills to build and submit an app that tells us about you."_

This repository houses my successful [scholarship submission](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/scholarships/) for WWDC 2015. While not published to the App Store, it serves as an example of my work in Swift. I intend to keep it up-to-date to test out new Swift features as they are developed.

Some screenshots are included below, just for fun.
